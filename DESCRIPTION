Description: Biterm Topic Model is a word co-occurrence based topic model that learns topics by modeling word-word co-occurrences patterns.
    In constrast, LDA and PLSA are word-document co-occurrence topic models, since they model word-document co-occurrences.
    A biterm consists of two words co-occurring in the same context, for example, in the same short text window. 
    The techniques are explained in detail in the paper: 'A Biterm Topic Model For Short Text', available at <doi:10.1.1.402.4032>.
